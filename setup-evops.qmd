## Save evops app image

:::{.callout-important}
Before saving for the first time the docker image of the **evops app**, create a folder in your computer which is dedicated to the backup of evops app image in the host computer. To illustrate, we have created a folder called **my_images** at the location:
```{bash}
C:\Users\HEWLETT-PACKARD\Documents\workdir\my_images
```

### From Windows Terminal


To save a docker image as a **.tar** archive for sharing, one can proceed as described below in Windows Terminal **after starting Docker Desktop**. This two-step procedure exploits the **docker save** command whose use is explained on the following web page <https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/save/>.

1. Open a Windows Terminal. Copy and paste the docker command below in the open Terminal and hit the **Enter** key on the keyboard to display the list of available docker images. Note that the names of the found docker images and the related versions are respectively listed under the **REPOSITORY** and the **TAG** columns of the output.
```{bash}
docker images
```


2. Copy and paste the command below in the open Terminal and hit the **Enter** key on the keyboard to start the backup process. This command is made up of three parts. The first part is **docker save**. The second part specifies the argument of the **output** option which is the path to the **.tar** archive to create. The third part indicates the name and the version of the docker image to save in the form **REPOSITORY:TAG**. It follows that before using the command below, the location **`C:\Users\HEWLETT-PACKARD\Documents\workdir\my_images`** must be replaced with a valid location in your computer.
```{bash}
docker save --output C:\Users\HEWLETT-PACKARD\Documents\workdir\my_images\dkengne_evops_latest.tar dkengne/evops:latest
```

### From Windows Terminal


To load an archived docker image, one can proceed as described below in Windows Terminal **after starting Docker Desktop**. This two-step procedure exploits the **docker load** command whose use is explained on the following web page <https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/load/>.

1. Copy and paste the command below in the open Terminal and hit the **Enter** key on the keyboard to start the backup restoration process. This command is made up of two parts. The first part is **docker load**. The second part specifies the argument of the **input** option which is the path to the **.tar** archive to load.  It follows that before using the command below, the file path **`C:\Users\HEWLETT-PACKARD\Documents\workdir\my_images\dkengne_evops_latest.tar`** must be replaced with an appropriate file path in your computer.
```{bash}
docker load --input C:\Users\HEWLETT-PACKARD\Documents\workdir\my_images\dkengne_evops_latest.tar
```

2. Copy and paste the docker command below in the open Terminal and hit the **Enter** key on the keyboard to check whether the list of available docker images includes the one just loaded. Note that the names of the found docker images and the related versions are respectively listed under the **REPOSITORY** and the **TAG** columns of the output.
